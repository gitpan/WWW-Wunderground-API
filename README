NAME
    WWW::Wunderground::API - Use Weather Underground's XML or JSON interface

VERSION
    Version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
    Connects to the Weather Underground JSON/XML service and parses the data
    into something usable. The entire response is available in
    Hash::AsObject form, so any data that comes from the server is
    accessible. Print a Data::Dumper of ->data to see all of the tasty data
    bits.

        use WWW::Wunderground::API;

        #location
        my $wun = new WWW::Wunderground::API('Fairfax, VA');

        #or zipcode
        my $wun = new WWW::Wunderground::API('22030');

        #or airport identifier
        my $wun = new WWW::Wunderground::API('KIAD');

        #using the json API.
        my $wun = new WWW::Wunderground::API(location=>'KIAD', api_key=>'your wunderground API key');

        print 'The temperature is: '.$wun->data->temp_f."\n";
        print 'The rest of the world calls that: '.$wun->temp_c."\n"; #Keys are AUTOLOADed to $wun->data->$key for lazy typers.
        print 'XML source:'.$wun->xml if $wun->api_type eq 'xml';
        print 'JSON source:'.$wun->json if $wun->api_type eq 'json';

  update()
    Refetch data from the server. This is called automatically every time
    location is set, but you may want to put it in a timer.

  location()
    Change the location. For example:

        my $wun = new WWW::Wunderground::API('22030');
        my $ffx_temp = $wun->data->temp_f;

        $wun->location('KJFK');
        my $ny_temp = $wun->data->temp_f;

        $wun->location('San Diego, CA');
        my $socal_temp = $wun->data->temp_f;

  xml()
    Returns raw xml result from wunderground server where applicable

  json()
    Returns raw json result from wunderground server where applicable

  data()
    Contains all weather data from server parsed into convenient
    Hash::AsObject form;

  api_key()
    Required for JSON api access.

  api_type()
    Defaults to xml. If an api_key is specified, this will be set to json.
