NAME
    WWW::Wunderground::API - Use Weather Underground's XML interface

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    Connects to the Weather Underground XML weather conditions URL and
    parses the data into something usable. The entire response is available
    in Hash::AsObject form, so any data that comes from the server is
    accessible. Print a Data::Dumper of ->data to see all of the tasty data
    bits.

        use WWW::Wunderground::API;

        #location
        my $wun = new WWW::Wunderground::API('Fairfax, VA');

        #or zipcode
        my $wun = new WWW::Wunderground::API(22030);

        #or airport identifier
        my $wun = new WWW::Wunderground::API('KIAD');

        print 'The temperature is: '.$wun->data->temp_f;
        print 'XML source:'.$wun->xml;

  update()
    Refetch data from the server. This is called automatically every time
    location is set, but you may want to put it in a timer.

  location()
    Change the location. For example:

        my $wun = new WWW::Wunderground::API(22030);
        my $ffx_temp = $wun->data->temp_f;
        $wun->location('KJFK');
        my $ny_temp = $wun->data->temp_f;
        $wun->location('San Diego, CA');
        my $socal_temp = $wun->data->temp_f;

  xml()
    Returns raw xml result from wunderground server

  data()
    Contains xml result from server parsed into convenient Hash::AsObject
    form;
